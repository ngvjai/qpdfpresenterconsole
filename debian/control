Description: Beamer-targetted presentation tool.
 QPdfPresenterConsole is a software inspired by both Apple's
 Keynote and Pdf Presenter Console
 [http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/pdf_presenter_console.html]
 written using Qt4. Thus, it is easy to use, extend and
 port.  Currently, it runs smoothly on any Linux which has
 XRandR capabilities, and Windows 7 at least.
