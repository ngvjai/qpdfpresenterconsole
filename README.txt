QPdfPresenterConsole is a software inspired by both Apple's Keynote and
Pdf Presenter Console [http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/pdf_presenter_console.html]
written using Qt4. Thus, it is easy to use, extend and port.
Currently, it runs smoothly on any Linux which has XRandR capabilities, and
Windows 7 at least.
